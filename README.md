## Frontend â€“ Video Conference App

The frontend provides:

- Video conferencing with camera/mic control  
- Screen sharing  
- Real-time chat  
- Task board with drag & drop and done/in-progress status  
- Collaborative whiteboard  

### Tech Stack

- **React.js (Vite)**  
- **Socket.IO Client**  
- **Tailwind CSS**  

### Live Frontend Deployment

You can access the live frontend here:  
[Frontend App](https://video-conference-app-frontend-f6zvko7ir.vercel.app/)

### Running Locally

```bash
it clone https://github.com/NandhuTee/video-conference-app-frontend.git
cd video-conference-app-frontend
```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install```
   
3. Create a .env file with the backend URL:
   ```ini

The app will run on http://localhost:5173 (or the port shown in the console).

Make sure the backend is running and accessible.

```vbnet 
This gives your mentor a **live link, frontend features, and instructions to run locally**.  

If you want, I can **combine both frontend & backend README sections** into a single **final README** for submission. Do you want me to do that?

git clone https://github.com/NandhuTee/video-conference-app-frontend.git
